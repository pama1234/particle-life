   *            particle and j the type of the other particle.
   * @param pos Position of the neighbor relative to the particle's own position, with its length
   *            divided by rmax, so this vector will always have a length <= 1.
   * @return The acceleration that should be applied to the particle's velocity. This is also
   *         interpreted as relative to rmax, that is, it will be scaled by rmax before it is
   *         applied to the particle.
